# WGCNA
R and Bash scripts used for generating and analysing weighted gene co-expression networks. I'm happy to announce that there is now a complete walkthrough for a basic network analysis on the Wiki page of this repository (https://github.com/Persilian/WGCNA/wiki). For other good resources and tutorials go to the WGCNA author's website designated to that purpose: https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/
