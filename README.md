R and Bash scripts used for generating weighted gene co-expression networks and analyze them. I'm happy to announce that there is now a complete walkthrough for a basic network analysis on the Wiki page of this repository. For other good resources and tutorials go to the WGCNA author's website designated to that purpose: https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/
